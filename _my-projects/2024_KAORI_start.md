### How to Swim?

I decided to start swimming, following my roommate who became the president of our university swim club. To join the club, I had to swim 1,500 meters nonstop. Having never learned how to swim before, I was worried about whether I could master freestyle in just three weeks—
**but I did it!**

After several months of training, I was even able to manage all four strokes, more or less. Still, compared to those who had been swimming for years, I have a long way to go. [Photo credit: Alex]

### My First Swim Competition

I thought I might see some results since I had been attending swim practices for quite a while, but of course, there weren’t any. In the women’s 100m freestyle, five swimmers competed, and I finished last by a wide margin.
Watching the race video later (thanks to my horrible diving skills), my friends and family couldn’t stop laughing.
At least I managed to bring some joy to others—and I guess that’s something to be happy about.

Although I didn’t achieve much individually, our team finished in 5th place overall. Since I also received a 5th-place medal, I was glad that I could contribute, even in a small way, to the team’s success.
